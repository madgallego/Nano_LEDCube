# 4x4x4 Ardunio Nano LED Cube Display

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a 4x4x4 LED Cube Display that visualizes dynamic patterns using an optimized software approach. The system employs:

A 2D array for managing LED pipes (left-right, connected to LED ground).

A 1D array for handling Cube LED layers (top-bottom, connected to LED positive).

By leveraging this structure, the project efficiently controls LED animations and enhances performance.
