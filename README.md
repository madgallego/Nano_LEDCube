# 4x4x4 Ardunio Nano LED Cube Display

<h3> ðŸ“Œ Project Overview</h3> 
This project is a 4x4x4 LED Cube Display that visualizes dynamic patterns using an optimized software approach. The system employs:

- A 2D array for managing LED pipes (left-right, connected to LED ground).

- A 1D array for handling Cube LED layers (top-bottom, connected to LED positive).

By leveraging this structure, the project efficiently controls LED animations and enhances performance.

<h3> ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Community Impact </h3>
The LED cube serves as an interactive visual display for learning and creativity in electronics, programming, and embedded systems. It is ideal for:

- Educational purposes (introducing students to microcontroller programming).

- Artistic LED installations (creating mesmerizing light patterns).

- Open-source hardware enthusiasts (enhancing modular lighting projects).

<h3> Features </h3>

- âœ… Optimized control using a two-dimensional and one-dimensional array approach.
- âœ… Customizable patterns for a unique visual experience.
- âœ… Open-source and easy-to-modify for experimentation and learning.
